### Engineer of Indeterminate States

I did not start in a computer lab. I started in a small town with a lot of energy and not enough direction. At 17, I traded that uncertainty for the structure of the military where I found myself operating Air Force radar systems and flying satellites. It was my first taste of critical applications and services but the path was not linear after that.

I spent years in the real world working construction, landscaping, and waiting tables. I know what it feels like to work a job that demands everything from your body but nothing from your mind. That is where I found mathematics. I fell in love with the absolute nature of it. I loved the feeling of knowing a solution is right because the logic holds.

I fought my way through an ECE degree while battling a persistent sense of impostor syndrome. When you come from the trades, sitting in a high tech office can feel like a cheap trick. But I did not have the luxury of quitting. For me, failure meant going back to the shovel and that was not an option.

My career has been defined by the Indeterminant State. At Dell, I found my niche in the high pressure world of data recovery. I took broken, chaotic storage arrays and brought them back to life. I learned that I am at my best when things are at their worst.

I have navigated significant personal loss and family instability that taught me how to stay grounded when everything else is falling apart. Today, I am navigating the complex world of S3 cloud storage at Wasabi. It has not been easy. The transition involved major personal and professional sacrifices but I keep showing up. I run to keep my mind sharp and I build to keep my skills sharper.

I am not a textbook engineer. I am a seasoned problem solver who knows exactly what it is like to have everything on the line. I do not just fix systems. I outlast them.
