### From Bare Metal to the Cloud

I’ve spent the last decade deep in the trenches of enterprise data storage. My career was built on the "bare metal" of the industry—mastering block and file storage as a Sustaining Engineer at Dell Technologies. I thrive on the grit of troubleshooting complex, mission-critical systems where downtime isn't an option.

Today, I’ve pivoted that expertise to the cutting edge of cloud infrastructure, supporting S3-compatible storage and AWS architectures. I don’t just move data; I optimize the systems that hold the world’s most valuable assets.

### The Human Side: Optimization is a Lifestyle

When I’m not architecting cloud solutions, I’m usually chasing a new Personal Best. Whether it’s training for a sub-5-minute mile, perfecting my golf swing, skiing with my family in Massachusetts, or traveling and cooking, I am driven by the "1% better" mindset. 

I’m a husband, a dad, and a lifelong builder. From copycat cookie recipes to local hardware projects on a Raspberry Pi Pico, I love the process of taking something apart to understand how to make it faster, stronger, and more efficient. I’m excited to see where the next chapter of this story goes—likely somewhere at the intersection of AI, Cloud, and high-performance systems.
